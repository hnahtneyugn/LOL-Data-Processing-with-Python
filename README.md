## Description
---
- This project is designed to crawl, clean and analyze data from the game League of Legends, then derive insights from that data .
- The data is also visualized afterwards, so that its distribution and related information can be gathered.
- There is also a small prediction model, the accuracy is not high, but it allows us to learn a little of Machine Learning.
- We developed a Dash application, which uses Dash Core Components and Dash Mantine Components, with Plotly to create charts and graphs.
- Other libraries are also used, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,....

## Installation
---
- Clone the repository.
- Install all required libraries. This can be done using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Your best choice is to install the libraries into a virtual environment.
- Makes sure to use the correct Python Intepreter for `.py` files, or Kernel for `.ipynb` files from your virtual environment.
- Run either `deploy.py` or `deploy.ipynb`, copy the address `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` and paste it on any browser except Safari (because it doesn't support my audio).
- You can explore this small app, click on any champion's icon to hear the audio when that champion is selected in the actual game. Its information will be displayed on the right side.

## Future improvements
---
1. Collect more data.
2. Draw more graphs.
3. Improve the interface.
4. Use API instead of downloaded audio files.
